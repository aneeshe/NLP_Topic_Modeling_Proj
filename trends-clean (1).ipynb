Neuro checks were done and no problems were documented.<BR/>The bed alarm was documented in the Medication Administration Record [REDACTED].<BR/>The facility fall investigation for the resident dated 11/13/14 revealed an unwitnessed fall. <BR/>On 11/25/14 at 12:20 PM observed resident eating lunch in the dining room with non-skid socks on and no personal alarm in place.<BR/>On 11/26/2014 at 7:20 AM observed direct care staff Q assisting the resident to transfer from the shower chair to his/her wheelchair with extensive assistance. The resident stood holding onto a grab bar while staff Q held onto the gait belt around the resident while prompting him/her to turn into his/her wheelchair and placing the personal alarm on the resident.<BR/>An interview on 11/26/2014 at 7:42 AM with direct care staff Q stated that he/she checks personal alarms on all the residents under his/her care every 2 hours and when he/she toilets them to make sure their alarms are in working order. If one is not working he/she can get batteries from the nurse or storage if needed.<BR/>An interview on 11/26/14 at 9:47 am with licensed nursing staff D stated; the CNA ' s have an alarm check list that they go by to see what residents have personal alarms. The resident takes his/hers off constantly. He/she monitors the CNA's and CMA's work by their documentation on the alarm check list and by the CMA's charting in the medication administration record. <BR/>On 12/1/14 at 12:15 PM administrative staff C stated the director of nursing updated the care plans a couple of months ago. <BR/>The facility's fall policy dated 1/22/13 stated that when bed or personal alarms are placed on a resident they will be checked daily for function battery life and placement. <BR/>The facility failed to review and revise the plan of care to ensure provision of appropriate interventions to prevent further falls. <BR/>\n"
